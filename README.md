# EmailScheduler
An automated email scheduler application that allows users to send emails at specified times every day if the code stays running. Features a user-friendly GUI and supports multiple recipients. 
## Email Setup

For security reasons, you may need to use an app password instead of your regular email password. Here are instructions for some common email providers:

### Gmail

1. Ensure that 2-Step Verification is enabled for your Google account.
2. Generate an app password:
   - Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
   - Navigate to `Security`.
   - Under `Signing in to Google`, select `App passwords`.
   - Follow the instructions to generate an app password.
   - If this does not work, search 'App password' in your Google account search bar 
3. Use this app password instead of your regular password when prompted by the Email Scheduler.
